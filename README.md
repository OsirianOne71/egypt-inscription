# egypt-inscription
Creates a chisled sandstone image of hieroglyphics atring, virtically or horizontally, and inscribes the glyph characters you either paste directly or a string of Unicode Hex or combination of; then renders the final as a PNG image with. name you chose, automatically scaled to fit your characters.

i.e.  u1300

Next Branch - will allow you to render the character string surrounded by a shen   "I e. cartouche" if it's a name.

Possible edition: create a API call to an Phonetic name converter to heiroglyphs, and capture that string to auto insert into the shen.
